- Video capture and processing
- Face tracking with bounding boxes
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Camera access with user permission handling
- Automatic cleanup of camera resources when component unmounts

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **OpenCV.js** - JavaScript library for computer vision and image processing
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **HTML5 Canvas** - For rendering face detection results
